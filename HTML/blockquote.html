    <p>This is about the information on Telugu Language</p>
    <blockquote cite="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Telugu_Wikipedia">In 2005, the Hindi Wikipedia received a boost when Chava Kiran, Akkineni Pradeep, Vyzas Satya, Veeven and Charivari joined; Charivari later spearheaded the Telugu campaign. Satya planned and executed a project to add stubs for districts, mandals and Telugu films with the aid of a bot. The stubs were expanded into articles with the help of volunteers from the Telugu online and blogging communities. Charivari translated and drafted many of the initial policies, Pradeep wrote scripts automating mundane tasks and the article count increased to 6,000.</blockquote>
